minOPOSD is an add-on to the ArduCamOSD/MinimOSD-Extra project.

With this add-on you can use the MinimOSD hardware in combination with a flight control from OpenPilot like CC3D and Revo (it is not working with the older OPCC) which uses UAVTalk as communication protocol.

It is working with OpenPilot-RELEASE 12.10.1, OpenPilot-RELEASE 12.10.2, OpenPilot-RELEASE 13.06.1, OpenPilot-RELEASE 13.06.2, OpenPilot-RELEASE 14.01, OpenPilot-RELEASE 14.06, OpenPilot-RELEASE 14.10, OpenPilot-RELEASE 15.01, OpenPilot-RELEASE 15.02

Not every panel is portet 1 to 1 compared to MinimOSD-Extra.
